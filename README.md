## Instructions

This is a memory game, just like the cardboard memory games played by young children.To begin, click two cards. They will turn over and display shapes. If the two cards are not a match, then the cards will flip themselves back over. If they are a match, the cards will turn green and stay face up.

If the player becomes distracted while playing, or frustrated at lack of matches, s/he can click the circular arrow button above the game board, and the player will receive a new shuffled deck.

The game is won when the player has reached 8 matches. A popup window will appear with the player's time, number of moves, and star rating. If the player would like to play again, just click the replay button.

This game can be played on any device and is responsive.

  Completion of this project would not have happened without the help of Matt Cranford and Danny Smith, both of whom took time to review my code and help me figure out the functionality.
